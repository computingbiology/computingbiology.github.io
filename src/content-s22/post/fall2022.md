This course will be offered again in in Fall 2022. The course will be
somewhat similar to the Spring 2022 course (which you can explore
here, including the [Syllabus](/syllabus/) and [Schedule](/schedule),
but with some changes based on what we learned last spring and new
versions of these will be posted soon.

The Fall 2022 course is scheduled for Tuesdays and Thursdays,
12:30-1:45pm in Olsson Hall 120.
