## Project Presentations

Each team will have an opportunity to present your project to the
class on either Wednesday, 27 April or Monday, 2 May. You will have
**5 minutes** maximum for your presentation (which will need to be
enforced strictly to be able to complete all the presentations within
the schedule class period). It is fine if your presentation is shorter
(which might even allow time for questions), but you should keep the
time limit in mind in planning your presentation.

Teams presenting should submit your slides as either a PDF file, a
link to a (publicly-visible) URL, or a PowerPoint file by sending a
slack message in your team channel to me no later than 10:29am on the
date of your presentation.
