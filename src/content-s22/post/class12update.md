USPTO has made a ruling in the CRISPR patent dispute we talked about
yesterday!

The ruling is in favor of MIT/Harvard (Broad Institute), determining
that they have priority in CRISPR-Cas9 system for editing eukaryotic
cells, over the CVC (this is the case name for the Berkeley/University
of Vienna assignees of the Doudna/Charpentier patent)
patent. (Although this ruling is now in effect, I doubt this well be
the end of things, and suspect the CVC lawyers are looking for ways to
appeal.)

You can read the full ruling here: [Decision on Priority
37 C.F.R. ยง 41.125(a)](/docs/usptocrispr.pdf). It is quite fascinating reading, with lots of quotes from emails between the scientists and scans from lab notebooks (see pages 30-31 for a nice sketch for tracrRNA and Cas9 cleaving).

Update: [Jacob Sherkow's twitter
thread](https://twitter.com/jsherkow/status/1498413788994940928)
provides a great explanation of the whole episode and latest ruling
(and contrary my doubts above, thinks further appeals from CVC are
unlikely).
