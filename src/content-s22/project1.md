To get started on Project 1, one of the team members should fork this github repo: [https://github.com/computingbiology/Project-1-Genome-Assembly](https://github.com/computingbiology/Project-1-Genome-Assembly).

The file, [project1.ipynb](https://github.com/computingbiology/Project-1-Genome-Assembly/blob/main/project1.ipynb) in the repository is a [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook that has the assignment and is where you will enter your answers.

You'll be able to get started on the assignment by running: `jupyter notebook project1.ipynb`.

If you don't have Jupyter installed, you'll need to install this first: `pip install jupyterlab` or see [https://jupyter.org/install](https://jupyter.org/install) for more details and other options.
