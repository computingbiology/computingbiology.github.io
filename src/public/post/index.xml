      <description>Schedule (repeated from Class 16) Quiz 2 will be on Thursday, November 3 and will focus on material from Classes 14 – 18 (mostly on editing genomes, but also including most likely one question on the discussion of Quiz 1 from Class 14.)
Project reports are due Monday, 7 November. This should be a complete project report, which will be graded. You will receive feedback on it, and have an opportunity to revise and improve.</description>

      <description>Schedule Quiz 2 was originally scheduled to be October 27, but since we won&amp;rsquo;t have finished genome editing until later, it is now rescheduled for November 3. (Quiz 3 will also be rescheduled for some later date.)
Project reports are due Monday, 7 November. This should be a complete project report, which will be graded. You will receive feedback on it, and have an opportunity to revise and improve.

      <description>Project 2 Project 2 is now posted, and is due on Wednesday, 21 September, 8:59pm.
Correction to Alignment Code! As was noticed in class today, the code for the gap-based alignment algorithms is wrong. The loops should include all values up to and including j (so should be
range(1, j + 1) instead of
range(1, j) (note that range in Python iterates through the values from the first input up to, but not including, the second input value, so to include j in the iteration, we need to use j + 1 in the range).</description>

      <description>Project 1 Project 1 is now posted, and is due on Monday, September 5 (8:59pm). Students will work in teams of two for Project 1, with constraints as discussed in Class 2: you can choose your partner or be assigned one “randomly” after class (today). If you choose your own partner, your team must satisfy these constraints:
 Both teammates went to different high schools Your answers to at least one of these questions must be different:  What country were you born in?</description>

      <description>Schedule and Readings Before 8:59pm Wednesday 24 August:
 Read the Syllabus, Pledge, and complete the Registration Survey. After you submit the Registration Survey, you will receive an invitation (to the github account you include in your survey) to join the course github site (which will enable you to join the github discussions).  Before Tuesday&amp;rsquo;s class, 30 August:
  Read Chapters 1 &amp;ndash; 10 of Hubert&amp;rsquo;s The DNA Book (the chapters are very short and interesting, so its not as much as it sounds).</description>

      <description>Here is a guide to the computing theory background expected for students entering this course.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve completed cs 2130 (Computer Systems and Organization 1) and a good Theory of Computation or Algorithms course (the official pre-requisites for this course) and remember the big ideas from that class, this should all be familiar to you already, but it may still be useful to refresh your understanding using these materials.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t taken the prerequisite courses and are getting up to speed on your own, we hope these materials will be helpful.</description>
