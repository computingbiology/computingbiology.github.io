      <description>As discussed in Class 4, your final project can be on anything you want that is related to this course. We want your final projects to be interesting and fun to work on, and to produce something of value beyond just satisfying an expectation of this course.
We are expecting most students will do one of these types of projects:
  Systematization Projects: Start with a curious question, learn what is currently understood about it from the research literature, and produce something to explain it to computer scientists.</description>

      <description>USPTO has made a ruling in the CRISPR patent dispute we talked about yesterday!
The ruling is in favor of MIT/Harvard (Broad Institute), determining that they have priority in CRISPR-Cas9 system for editing eukaryotic cells, over the CVC (this is the case name for the Berkeley/University of Vienna assignees of the Doudna/Charpentier patent) patent. (Although this ruling is now in effect, I doubt this well be the end of things, and suspect the CVC lawyers are looking for ways to appeal.</description>

      <description>You can join the course slack (with any @virginia.edu email address) by visiting: https://join.slack.com/t/computingbiology/signup.
We won&amp;rsquo;t expect students to be on the course slack until the first class (Wednesday, Jan 19 at 12:30pm), but feel free to join early!
(If you want to join but don&amp;rsquo;t have an @virginia.edu email address, contact the course instructor.)</description>

      <description>Here is a guide to the computing theory background expected for students entering this course.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve completed cs2150 and a good Theory of Computation or Algorithms course (the official pre-requisites for this course) and remember the big ideas from that class, this should all be familiar to you already, but it may still be useful to refresh your understanding using these materials.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t taken the prerequisite courses and are getting up to speed on your own, we hope these materials will be helpful.</description>

      <description>This is the course website for &amp;ldquo;Computational Biology / Biological Computing&amp;rdquo;, a new University of Virginia course targeted to undergraduate computer science students that will be offered for the first time in Spring 2022. Scheduled course meetings are Mondays and Wednesday, 12:30pm – 1:45pm, in Olsson Hall 018, starting on 19 January 2022.
This course will look at connections between computing and biology, with a focus on DNA. It will include computational methods used in biology focusing on how computing can be used to analyze and design DNA, as well as opportunities to use biological substances and ideas to compute.</description>
