      <description>Honor Expectations As a student at the University of Virginia, you are trusted to be honorable and expected to behave in ways that merit that trust. We take advantage of this trust to provide a better learning environment for everyone. In particular, students in this course are expected to follow these rules throughout the course:
I will not lie, cheat or steal. If I am unsure whether something would be considered lying, cheating or stealing, I will ask before doing it.</description>

      <description>This syllabus is a &amp;ldquo;semi-living document&amp;rdquo; (i.e., more like a virus than a bacterium) subject to change as we adapt during the semester. The course website is managed through a public github repository, so you can see past versions and changes there.
The version as posted on the first day of class is here
Overview Course Description: This course will look at connections between computing and biology, with a focus on DNA.</description>

      <description>You can join the course slack (with any @virginia.edu email address) by visiting: https://computingbiology.slack.com.
We won&amp;rsquo;t expect students to be on the course slack until the first class (Wednesday, Jan 19 at 12:30pm), but feel free to join early!
(If you want to join but don&amp;rsquo;t have an @virginia.edu email address, contact the course instructor.)</description>

      <description>Here is a guide to the computing theory background expected for students entering this course.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve completed cs2150 and a good Theory of Computation or Algorithms course (the official pre-requisites for this course) and remember the big ideas from that class, this should all be familiar to you already, but it may still be useful to refresh your understanding using these materials.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t taken the prerequisite courses and are getting up to speed on your own, we hope these materials will be helpful.</description>

      <title>Cost of Computation</title>

      <description>When we consider the power of our computing models, we have been concerned with understanding what functions can be computed (in theory, which means without any arbitrary limits on their execution) by different computing models. When we want to actual compute using physical computers, cost matters.
For concerete computations where we already know the input and have an implementation of the algorithm, we can measure the cost of executing the algorithm by just running it and recording the cost.</description>

      <title>Models of Computation</title>

      <description>To reason precisely about what computers can and cannot do, we need abstract models that capture the things we think are important but avoid the complexities of physical objects.
Models and Mathematics The physical world is messy and suffers from arbitrary limits — this applies both to the physical computing devices we use (which always have some probability of failing and can&amp;rsquo;t even do arithmetic correcly) and even more so to biological systems we consider in this class.</description>

      <description>This is the course website for &amp;ldquo;Computational Biology / Biological Computing&amp;rdquo;, a new University of Virginia course targeted to undergraduate computer science students that will be offered for the first time in Spring 2022. Scheduled course meetings are Mondays and Wednesday, 12:30pm – 1:45pm, in Olsson Hall 018, starting on 19 January 2022.
This course will look at connections between computing and biology, with a focus on DNA. It will include computational methods used in biology focusing on how computing can be used to analyze and design DNA, as well as opportunities to use biological substances and ideas to compute.</description>
