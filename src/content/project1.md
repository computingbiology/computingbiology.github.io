To get started on Project 1, one of the team members should fork this github repo: [https://github.com/computingbiology/Project-1-Genome-Assembly](https://github.com/computingbiology/Project-1-Genome-Assembly).

The file, [project1.ipynb](https://github.com/computingbiology/Project-1-Genome-Assembly/blob/main/project1.ipynb) in the repository is a [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook that has the assignment and is where you will enter your answers. Once you've installed jupyter (`pip install jupyterlab` or see [https://jupyter.org/install](https://jupyter.org/install) for more details and other options), you'll be able to get started on the assignment by running: `jupyter notebook project1.ipynb`.
