If you don't have Jupyter installed, you'll need to install this first: `pip install jupyterlab` or see [https://jupyter.org/install](https://jupyter.org/install) for more details and other options.

Then, to get started on Project 1, one of the team members should fork this github repo: [https://github.com/computingbiology/Project-1-2022F](https://github.com/computingbiology/Project-1-2022F)
(you can do this by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right of the page)

Clone your forked repository to have a local copy to work on:
```
   git clone https://github.com/<your github id>/Project-1-2022F.git
```

Then, you'll be able to get started on the assignment by running (in the repo directory):
```
   jupyter notebook project1.ipynb
```   

Follow the directions in that file for what to do, including how to submit the assignment using this form:

Happy Assembling!
