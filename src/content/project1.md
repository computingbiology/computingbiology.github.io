To get started on Project 1, one of the team members should fork this github repo: [https://github.com/computingbiology/Project-1-2022F](https://github.com/computingbiology/Project-1-2022F)

If you don't have Jupyter installed, you'll need to install this first: `pip install jupyterlab` or see [https://jupyter.org/install](https://jupyter.org/install) for more details and other options.

You'll be able to get started on the assignment by running (in the repo directory): `jupyter notebook project1.ipynb`.

Follow the directions in that file for what to do, including how to submit the assignment using this form:
