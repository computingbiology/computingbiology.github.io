We are expecting to offer [cs4501: Computational Biology / Biological Computing](https://computingbiology.github.io/) in Fall 2022. The course will be similar to the Spring 2022 course (which you can explore here, including the [Syllabus](/syllabus/) and [Schedule](/schedule).

The Fall 2022 course is scheduled for Tuesdays and Thursdays,
12:30-1:45pm in Olsson Hall 120.
