## Honor Expectations

As a student at the University of Virginia, you are trusted to be
honorable and expected to behave in ways that merit that trust. We
take advantage of this trust to provide a better learning environment
for everyone. In particular, students in this course are expected to
follow these rules throughout the course:

**I will not lie, cheat or steal.** If I am unsure whether something
  would be considered lying, cheating or stealing, I will ask before
  doing it.

**I will carefully read and follow the collaboration policy on each
  assignment.** I will not abuse resources in ways that would be
  clearly detrimental to my own learning or unfair to other
  students. 

## Community Expectations

As a member of a learning community of students, faculty, and staff,
you are expected to exemplify these behaviors in this course:

**I will actively affirm the value and dignity of others and treat my
  peers with decency and respect.** I understand that one of the
  benefits of attending the University is to be part of a vibrant
  community that encompasses a wide range of backgrounds, ethnicities,
  personal and family histories, and world views. I will contribute to
  that community by sharing things that are unique about me with
  others, fighting against any biases I may have or that I observe in
  others, and being open to and respectful of people who are different
  from me. I will listen to the perspectives of others, and amplify
  those whose voices are not well heard.

**I will not behave in ways that harrass, intimidate, diminish, or
  belittle others.** If I observe such behaviors in others (including
  among my classmates, the course staff, or other University faculty),
  I will not tolerate them silently, but will either take it upon
  myself to mitigate them, or will inform one of the course
  instructors or another University administrator.

**I will care for myself physically and emotionally.** Living during
  an extended pandemic can make it difficult to maintain your physical
  and emotional well-being. I will ensure that whatever I am doing to
  succeed in my courses does not take priority over my needs to
  exercise, stay hydrated, make time to eat lunch and dinner away from
  your workspace, and to safely spend time outside.

**I will avoid putting myself and others at unnecessary risk or
  discomfort.** I will follow the University's pandemic policies. If I
  have reason to suspect I might be infected, either due to
  experiencing symptoms or having close contact with someone who has
  symptoms or has tested positive, I will not come to class and will
  notify the instructor for any relevant course issues.

**I will be connected with others, and look out of the well-being of
others.** The ongoing pandemic has resulted in much suffering and many
hardships among our community, and continues to put many people under
stress.  We hope this class will also become a supportive
community. Be creative in maintaining and reinforcing that community
through the struggles caused by the pandemic, and seek out and
maximize opportunities for postive interactions with fellow students
and others in the university community.

**I will ask for help.** I will make a reasonable effort to do things
on my own first, but will ask for help before getting overly
frustrated. There are many ways to ask for help including the [github
discussions](https://github.com/computingbiology/spring2022/discussions)
site, [course slack](https://computingbiology.github.io/slack/), and
in person during class and office hours.

**I will be open minded and curious.** I understand that this course
  may do things in ways differently from what I expect, and may
  sometimes buck conventions that have been followed in other courses
  I have taken. I will ask questions when things make me
  uncomfortable, but also accept that being surprised, facing
  uncertainty, and being challenged with problems it is unreasonable
  to expect me to be able to solve, are often beneficial for learning
  new ways of thinking.

**I grant the course staff permission to reproduce excerpts from my
  submissions for teaching purposes.** My work will be attributed when
  it is shown in a postive way, but may be used anonymously if it is
  used to illustrate common pitfalls or other issues.

**I will provide useful feedback.** I realize that this is a new
  course which will be attempting some new things. It is important
  that I let the course staff know what they need to improve the
  course. I will provide feedback either anonymously or by contacting
  the course staff directly. I will fill out all requested surveys
  honestly and thoroughly.
