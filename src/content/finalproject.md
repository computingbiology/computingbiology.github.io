Your final project can be on anything you want that is related to this
course. We want your final projects to be **interesting and fun** to
work on, and to **produce something of value** beyond just satisfying
an expectation of this course.

We are open to other types of projects, but are expecting most
students will do one of these types of projects:

- **Systematization Projects**: Start with a curious question, learn
what is currently understood about it from the research literature,
and produce something to explain it to computer scientists. This could
be a static or interactive web page, a video, improving a Wikipedia
page, or some other artifact.

- **Research Project**: conduct original research on a relevant
    topic. This starts by understanding what is already known and
    identifying a question to study. Then, applying tools you learned
    in this class, and others you learn on your own, to make progress
    on answering that question.

- **Tool-Building/Improving Project**: develop some tool that will be
    useful for computational biology research. It is probably more
    useful to make improvements or add a feature to a widely-used open
    source tool, than to build your own software from scratch.

- **Hobby Project**: replicate something for fun (e.g., sequence your
genome), and produce an artifact (most likely a web site) explaining
your experience in a way that will be interesting and useful to
others.

Your project doesn't need to fit into any of these categories, but
these should give you some ideas for the kinds of project you might
do. For more ideas, you can also look at the [projects from the Spring
2022 course](https://computingbiology.github.io/s22/finalprojects/).

## Project Goals

An ideal project will satisfy these desiderata:

- fun (for you to do, and for others to see)
- useful (at least to yourself, but hopefully to many)
- relevant (to the class, to yourself, to humanity)
- technically interesting

Your project is not required to satisfy _all_ of these, but should at
least partially satisfy most of them, and fully satisfy at least one
of them.

## Teams

For the final project, we encourage students to work in teams of three
people. This is not a strict requirement, however. You may work in a
larger team if you find a project idea that benefits from a larger
team and have a good plan for how to work together. You may also work
alone if you prefer to work alone _and_ make a convincing
justification to me why it is better for you to work alone on this
rather than as part of a team.

The impressiveness of your project should scale as at least the square
root of the number of people on your team, but with a baseline
expectation that everyone's project should be at least as impressive
as what would be expected of a three-person team. If your team is
larger, you would expected to do something approximately sqrt(N/3)
times as impressive as a three-person team (so a six-person team would
be expected to do something that is approximately [1.4
times](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=sqrt%286%2F3%29) as
impressive the standard three-person team project expectations).

You should not underestimate the need for management and structure as
your team size grows, and even a three-person team requires some
organization and leadership. If you have more than one person on your
team, your project proposal should include a plan for how to manage
your team and work well together.

## Deliverables

- **Project Team and Idea**, due Friday, 30 September ([AoE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth)). See the [Submission Form](https://forms.gle/bu5P7dMipRnnZEG49) for what is included in this.

- **Project Proposal**, due Friday, 14 October (AoE). Your project proposal will include:

1. The names and email ids for all members of your team.
   2. Title of your project: short description that clearly captures your
project idea.
   3. A short paragraph that describes the goal of your project.
   4. A project jusfication that explains how your planned project is likely to satisfy at least three of the goals above (fun, relevant, technically interesting, useful).
   5. State-of-the-art: your understanding of what is already available connected to the goal of your project. This could be other attempts to achieve the same goal (and why you think you can do something better), or work related to similar goals. A good state-of-the-art will include references to specific relevant work. For most types of projects, this would include research papers relevant to your topic.
   6. A project plan that explains the main tasks needed to successfully complete your project and what you will actually do.
   7. A management plan list of your team members and their roles and
responsibilities. If your team has more than two people, this should
also explain how you plan to coordinate and manage your team.

- There will be project updates in classes, October 18 through end end
  of the semester. More information will be provided about these
  later, but you should expect that your project team will be ready to
  provide a short update about what your project is and what you are
  doing.

- **Project Report**, due Monday, 7 November. This should be a
    complete project report, which will be graded. You will receive
    feedback on it, and have an opportunity to revise and improve.

- **Project Presentations**, during the last two classes. Teams may be
    selected to present on their projects.

- **Revised Project Report**, due Tuesday, 6 December. Final
    submission of the results of your project.
