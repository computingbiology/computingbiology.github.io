This is the course website for "Computational Biology / Biological
Computing", a new University of Virginia course targeted to
undergraduate computer science students that will be offered for the
first time in Spring 2022. Scheduled course meetings are Mondays and
Wednesday, 12:30pm &ndash; 1:45pm, in Olsson Hall 018, starting on 19
January 2022.

This course will look at connections between computing and biology,
with a focus on DNA. It will include computational methods used in
biology focusing on how computing can be used to analyze and design
DNA, as well as opportunities to use biological substances and ideas
to compute.

**Expected Background.** No previous background in biology is
expected. Expected computing background is having successfully
completed cs2150 and at least one of cs3102 or cs4102, or comparable
experience.
