## Project 1

[Project 1](/project1) is now posted, and is due on **Monday,
September 5** (8:59pm). Students will work in teams of two for Project
1, with constraints as discussed in Class 2: you can choose your
partner or be assigned one “randomly” after class (today). If you
choose your own partner, your team must satisfy these constraints:

1. Both teammates went to different high schools
2. Your answers to at least one of these questions must be different:
   - What country were you born in?
   - Have you taken any biology courses at UVA?
   - Have you taken a Theory of Computation course?

## Slides

The slides will be posted here: [class2.pdf](TODO)
