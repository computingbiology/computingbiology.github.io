## Project 1

[Project 1](/project1) is now posted, and is due on **Monday,
September 5** (8:59pm). Students will work in teams of two for Project
1, with constraints as discussed in Class 2: you can choose your
partner or be assigned one “randomly” after class (today). If you
choose your own partner, your team must satisfy these constraints:

1. Both teammates went to different high schools
2. Your answers to at least one of these questions must be different:
   - What country were you born in?
   - Have you taken any biology courses at UVA?
   - Have you taken a Theory of Computation course?

## Readings

(Repeated from [Class 1](/class1))

Before **Tuesday's class, 30 August**:

- Read Chapters 1 -- 10 of Hubert's [The DNA
  Book](https://berthub.eu/dna-book/toc-real/) (the chapters are very
  short and interesting, so its not as much as it sounds). To access the early version
  of this book that we have access to, you will need the login
  information from [github discussions](https://github.com/computingbiology/fall2022/discussions/3). (This link will work after you have joined the course github site, see above.)

- Read Chapter 3 (at least through the end of 3.8) of _Bioinformatics
Algorithms_: [_How do we assemble genomes?_](//www.bioinformaticsalgorithms.org/bioinformatics-chapter-3). (This will be the focus of the first project, which is due on Monday, 5 September.
