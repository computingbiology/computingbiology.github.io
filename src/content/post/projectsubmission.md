The form for submitting your final project is here:
[Final Project Artifact Submission Form](https://forms.gle/7fd47kgonFm3z8uT8)

You should submit your final project by Tuesday, Dec 6 (AoE), which is
7:00am Eastern Time on Wednesday, Dec 7 (there is a 4 hour grace
period on this, so you can submit up to 11:00am Wednesday, Dec 7
without any need to arrange an extension).

Note: this is different from the form you should use to submit your presentation: [Project Presentation Form](https://forms.gle/fGeHa2PymchLXCzc9) (as mentioned [here](https://github.com/computingbiology/fall2022/discussions/52)).
