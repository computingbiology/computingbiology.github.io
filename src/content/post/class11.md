## Final Project

The first deliverable for the Final Project is the [Project Team and Idea Form](https://forms.gle/bu5P7dMipRnnZEG49), which we discussed in class today. It is due **tomorrow**, Friday, 30 September ([AoE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth)).  See the [Final Project Page](/finalproject) for more information on the final project.

## Reading Assignment

October 3 &ndash; 4 are Fall "Reading Days". I will be out of town and
not have my usual office hours on October 3. Your reading assignment (to complete before our next class on Thursday, October 6) is this paper on computing with DNA:

- Leonard M. Adleman. [_Computing with DNA_](https://computingbiology.github.io/docs/adleman1998.pdf). Scientific American, August 1998.

An additional (optional) reading is an earlier, slightly more
technical, paper on the same experiment: Leonard Adleman, [_Molecular
Computation of Solutions to Combinatorial
Problems_](/docs/adleman1994.pdf), Science, November 1994.

We will talk about these in next Thursday's class, but please post any questions or thoughts you have on them in the [Discussions](https://github.com/computingbiology/fall2022/discussions).

## Quiz

We'll have our first quiz in class on Tuesday, 11 October (as
scheduled on the syllabus).  (If you are unable to make it to class on
October 11, let me know in advance and there will be an alternate way
to take the quiz.)

This and subsequent quizzes are not meant to be stressful and
something that will adversely impact grades for students who are doing
well, but are intented to provide "polite" nudges to encourage
students to do the readings and be engaged in classes, and to think
about and lightly review things we have done so far.

It will have questions (most of which will expect short answers) on:

- Big concepts in biology from classes + readings so far
- Main ideas in this week’s classes
- The assigned Adleman paper (above) and what we do in class next Thursday
