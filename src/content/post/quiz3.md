Quiz 3 is posted here: [Quiz 3](https://forms.gle/FjVNxhquXH7D3MBY7)

The quiz is untimed (no time limit enforced), but is expected to take
about 30 minutes.

Before taking the quiz, make sure you understand and are confident you
are able to follow the honor policy for this quiz:

- The quiz is closed resources. Once you start the quiz, you are not
  allowed to use any other materials. You should not switch to other
  browser tabs or look at any notes.

- The quiz is to be done on your own. Once you start the quiz, you
  should not consult with any other human or artificial intelligence
  for help on the quiz questions.

- After you complete the quiz, do not discuss the questions with
  anyone else in the class (since they may be planning to take the
  quiz later) until class Tuesday.

If you prefer to take the quiz on paper instead of the on-line form,
you can come to my office Monday at 1:30pm.
