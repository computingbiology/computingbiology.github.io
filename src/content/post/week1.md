- Join the [Course Slack](https://computingbiology.slack.com/)

Before **Monday's class, 24 January**:

- Read Chapters 1 -- 10 of Hubert's [The DNA
  Book](https://berthub.eu/dna-book/toc-real/) (the chapters are very
  short, so its not as much as it sounds). To access the early version
  of this book that we have access to, you will need the account
  information that will be sent to the course slack.

- Read Chapter 3 (at least through the end of 3.8) of _Bioinformatics
Algorithms_: [_How do we assemble genomes?_](//www.bioinformaticsalgorithms.org/bioinformatics-chapter-3). (This will be the focus of the first project, which will be out next week and due on Sunday, 6 February.

## Slides

The slides from class and links to additional materials will be posted
shortly after class.
