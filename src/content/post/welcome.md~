This is the course website for "Computational Biology / Biological
Computing", a new University of Virginia course targeted to
undergraduate computer science students that will be offered for the
first time in Spring 2022. Scheduled course meetings are Mondays and
Wednesday, 12:30pm &ndash; 1:45pm, in Olsson Hall 018, starting on 19 January 2022.

Below, you can read a preliminary description of the course and about
the reason for offering it. A syllabus and more information about the
course will be posted soon. The course size will be very limited for
Spring 2021, and more information will be posted about selecting
students for the course soon, but feel free to [contact me](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/evans) now if you have questions or are interested in joining.

### Course Description

Most decisions today are made by software, most of the rules of
society are interpreted and enforced by programs, and much human
interaction is now mediated by computing platforms that decide what
people see and who they can talk to. As the people who decide what
software gets written and how it is deployed, computer scientists have
disproportionate power to mold society. The goal of this course is
raise awareness and increase understanding of the moral and ethical
aspects of computing systems. We will do that through a mix of
readings and viewings, exercises and experiments, and writings,
presentations, and discussions.
