## Schedule and Readings

Before **8:59pm Wednesday 24 August**: 

- Read the [Syllabus](/syllabus/),
[Pledge](/pledge/), and complete the [Registration Survey](/survey).
- After you submit the [Registration Survey](/survey), you will receive an invitation (to the github account you include in your survey) to join the course github site (which will enable you to join the github discussions).

Before **Tuesday's class, 30 August**:

- Read Chapters 1 -- 10 of Hubert's [The DNA
  Book](https://berthub.eu/dna-book/toc-real/) (the chapters are very
  short, so its not as much as it sounds). To access the early version
  of this book that we have access to, you will need the login
  information from [github discussions](https://github.com/computingbiology/fall2022/discussions/3). (This link will work after you have joined the course github site, see above.)

- Read Chapter 3 (at least through the end of 3.8) of _Bioinformatics
Algorithms_: [_How do we assemble genomes?_](//www.bioinformaticsalgorithms.org/bioinformatics-chapter-3). (This will be the focus of the first project, which is due on Monday, 5 September.
