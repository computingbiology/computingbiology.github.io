## Schedule (repeated from [Class 16](/class16))

Quiz 2 will be on **Thursday, November 3** and will focus on material
from Classes 14 &ndash; 18 (mostly on editing genomes, but
also including most likely one question on the discussion of Quiz 1
from [Class 14](/class14).)

[Project reports](/finalproject) are due **Monday, 7 November**. This
should be a complete project report, which will be graded. You will
receive feedback on it, and have an opportunity to revise and improve.

## Readings (repeated from [Class 16](/class16))

Read before **Tuesday, 1 November** (but earlier is better):
- DNA Book: [Chapter 28: _Bacterial Virus Warfare_](https://berthub.eu/dna-book/private/bacterial-virus-warfare-crispr) and [Chapter 29: _Genetic Manipulation, CRISPR & beyond_](https://berthub.eu/dna-book/private/genetic-manipulation-crispr)

- Prarthana Mohanraju, Kira S. Makarova, Bernd Zetsche, Feng Zhang,
Eugene V. Koonin, John van der Oost. [_Diverse evolutionary roots and
mechanistic variations of the CRISPR-Cas systems_](/docs/mohanraju2016.pdf). Science, August 2016.

The quote about Eric Lander is from Michael Eisen's blog, [_The Villain of CRISPR_](https://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=1825):

> Lander’s recent essay in Cell entitled <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(15)01705-5">"The Heroes of CRISPR"</a> is his masterwork, at once so evil and yet so brilliant that I find it hard not to stand in awe even as I picture him cackling loudly in his Kendall Square lair, giant laser weapon behind him poised to destroy Berkeley if we don’t hand over our patents.

For a more positive view on Eric Lander (and a very interesting story), watch this episode from The Moth:
