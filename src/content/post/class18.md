## Schedule

**[Final Project](/finalproject)** idea is due Tuesday, 29 March
  (4:59pm). You should submit your Final Project Idea using [this
  form](https://forms.gle/hG8yu1X44hVb8Bfs6), which includes a place
  to upload a file to use for your presentation. This should be at
  most two slides that get across the purpose of your project (and
  include the names of your team). You will present your project idea
  in class on Wednesday, 30 March.
