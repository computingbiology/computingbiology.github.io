## Schedule

Quiz 2 will be on **Thursday, November 3** and will focus on material
from Classes 14 &ndash; 18 (mostly on editing genomes, but
also including most likely one question on the discussion of Quiz 1
from [Class 14](/class14).)

[Project reports](/finalproject) are due **Monday, 7 November**. This
should be a complete project report, which will be graded. You will
receive feedback on it, and have an opportunity to revise and improve.

## Readings

Read before **Tuesday, 1 November** (but earlier is better):
- DNA Book: [Chapter 28: _Bacterial Virus Warfare_](https://berthub.eu/dna-book/private/bacterial-virus-warfare-crispr) and [Chapter 29: _Genetic Manipulation, CRISPR & beyond_](https://berthub.eu/dna-book/private/genetic-manipulation-crispr)

- Prarthana Mohanraju, Kira S. Makarova, Bernd Zetsche, Feng Zhang,
Eugene V. Koonin, John van der Oost. [_Diverse evolutionary roots and
mechanistic variations of the CRISPR-Cas systems_](/docs/mohanraju2016.pdf). Science, August 2016.
