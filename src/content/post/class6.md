Due **Tuesday, 8 February (4:59pm)**: [Project 1](/project1)

Before **Wednesday, 9 February**:
- Read Chapter 19 -- 26 of Hubert's [The DNA
  Book](https://berthub.eu/dna-book/toc-real/). (Chapter 26 on _Mutations and Changes_ is the one most relevant to today's class.)
- Read Chapter 5 of the _Bioinformatics
Algorithms_: [_How do we compare biological sequences?_](//www.bioinformaticsalgorithms.org/bioinformatics-chapter-5).

Before **Monday, 14 Feb**:
- Chapter 26 of  Manolis Kellis et al., _Computational Biology - Genomes, Networks, and Evolution_: [_Molecular Evolution and Phylogenetics_](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Computational_Biology/Book%3A_Computational_Biology_-_Genomes_Networks_and_Evolution_(Kellis_et_al.)/26%3A_Molecular_Evolution_and_Phylogenetics) (also available as [[PDF](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Computational_Biology/Book%3A_Computational_Biology_-_Genomes_Networks_and_Evolution_(Kellis_et_al.)/26%3A_Molecular_Evolution_and_Phylogenetics#)]) (if you prefer to watch a video lecture that this chapter is based on, you can watch [_MIT CompBio Lecture 19 - Phylogenetics_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KduKR6IXcA)).

Some links to materials for the class:

- Orsolya Vincze, et al. [_Cancer risk across mammals_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04224-5), Nature, 22 December 2021. This is the paper with the diagram showing the cancer mortality risk variation across different orders of mammals (an "order" is taxonomic rank above a family).
