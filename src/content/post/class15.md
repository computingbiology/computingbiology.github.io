## Schedule

Quiz 2 was originally scheduled to be October 27, but since we won't have finished genome editing until later, it is now rescheduled for November 3.  (Quiz 3 will also be rescheduled for some later date.)

[Project reports](/finalproject) are due **Monday, 7 November**. This
    should be a complete project report, which will be graded. You
    will receive feedback on it, and have an opportunity to revise and
    improve.
