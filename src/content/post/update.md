I've posted the [_Schedule for Presentations_](https://github.com/computingbiology/fall2022/discussions/51) and a [Plan for this week](https://github.com/computingbiology/fall2022/discussions/52) on the github
discussions site. (Everyone should get email notifications for these
from the github site (if not, check that you have the "Watch" selected
for the repository), but I'm posting redundantly here in case you are
not getting them.)
