## Schedule and Readings

(These are duplicated from [Class 7](/class7).)

Before **Wednesday, 9 February**:
- Read Chapter 19 -- 26 of Hubert's [The DNA
  Book](https://berthub.eu/dna-book/toc-real/). (Chapter 26 on _Mutations and Changes_ is the one most relevant to today's class.)
- Read Chapter 5 of the _Bioinformatics
Algorithms_: [_How do we compare biological sequences?_](//www.bioinformaticsalgorithms.org/bioinformatics-chapter-5).

Before **Monday, 14 Feb**:
- Chapter 26 of  Manolis Kellis et al., _Computational Biology - Genomes, Networks, and Evolution_: [_Molecular Evolution and Phylogenetics_](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Computational_Biology/Book%3A_Computational_Biology_-_Genomes_Networks_and_Evolution_(Kellis_et_al.)/26%3A_Molecular_Evolution_and_Phylogenetics) (also available as [[PDF](/docs/kellis-ch26.pdf)]) (if you prefer to watch a video lecture that this chapter is based on, you can watch [_MIT CompBio Lecture 19 - Phylogenetics_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KduKR6IXcA)).

**Thursday, 24 Feb**:
- [**Project 2**](/project2)

MIT PhD Dissertation (Computational and Systems Biology), September 2018. (If you think PhD dissertations need to be intiminating, long, documents, please look at this one! Its only about 50 double-spaced sparse pages long, if you don't count the appendices, which are mostly pictures and directions of how you sample sewage.) The company that she co-founded that produced the data for the MWRA COVID-19 Tracking graph is [Biobot Analytics](https://www.biobot.io/).
