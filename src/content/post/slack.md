You can join the course slack (with any `@virginia.edu` email address)
by visiting:
[_https://computingbiology.slack.com_](https://computingbiology.slack.com).

We won't expect students to be on the course slack until the first
class (Wednesday, Jan 19 at 12:30pm), but feel free to join early!

(If you want to join but don't have an `@virginia.edu` email address, contact the [course instructor](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/evans).)
