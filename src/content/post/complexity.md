So far we have been concerned with understanding what functions can be
computed (in theory, which means without any arbitrary limits on their
execution) by different computing models, but have not considered what
it _costs_ to execute a computation.

For concerete computations where we already know the input and have an
implementation of the algorithm, we can measure the cost of executing
the algorithm
