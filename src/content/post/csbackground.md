This post is a guide to the computing background expected for students
entering this course.  If you've taken a good Theory of Computation or
Algorithms course and remember the big ideas from the class, you
should have most of this background already but it may still be useful
to refresh your understanding using these materials. If you haven't
taken the prerequisite courses and are getting up to speed on your
own, we hope these materials will be helpful. In class, we will
briefly review many of these concepts when they are relevant (and, of
course, I am happy to answer any questions and appreciate being
interrupted if I assume something that is unclear), but will review
them expecting students to already have fairly good understanding of
these ideas from previous courses.

## Modeling Computation

**Models and Mathematics.** The physical world is messy and suffers
  from arbitrary limits &mdash; this applies both to the physical
  computing devices we use (which always have some probability of
  failing and can't even do arithmetic correcly) and even more so to
  biological systems we consider in this class. Mathematics is precise
  and unconstrained &mdash; we can define formal systems that always
  behave in the prescribed way, can do operations without generating
  heat, and can be infinite. Mathematical models are useful because we
  can reason about them using the formal tools of mathematics, and can
  abstract away physical complexities and finite limits of physical
  reality. Mathematical models have proven uncannily useful in
  understanding and predicting properties of the physical world, but
  when we use them we have to be mindful that they are abstractions
  that avoid many of the messy aspects of physical reality.

  2011. [Norvig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI8Fo1vzUPM) starts
  with the observation that Wigner's claims about the effectiveness of
  simple mathematics to explain the universe are valid for a
  physicist, but not for biology - very little in biology can be
  explained with a short, simple equation. (The rest of the talk is
  about effectiveness of ML to solve problems in vision and language,
  but doesn't return to biology.)

**Modeling Computers.** To model a _computer_, we need to: (1) define
a set of mathematical objects that correspond to instances of the
computer we are modeling; and (2) define an execution model that shows
how any element in that set in that model executes. An _execution_ of
a computer takes
