Here is a guide to the computing background expected for students
entering this course.

If you've taken a good Theory of Computation or Algorithms course (the
official pre-requisite for this course) and remember the big ideas
from that class, this should all be familiar to you already, but it may
still be useful to refresh your understanding using these
materials.

If you haven't taken the prerequisite courses and are getting up to
speed on your own, we hope these materials will be helpful. In class,
we will briefly review many of these concepts when they are relevant
(and, of course, I am happy to answer any questions and appreciate
being interrupted if I assume something that is unclear), but will
review them expecting students to already have fairly good
understanding of these ideas from previous courses.
