Here is a guide to the computing theory background expected for
students entering this course.

If you've completed cs 2130 (Computer Systems and Organization 1) and
a good Theory of Computation or Algorithms course (the official
pre-requisites for this course) and remember the big ideas from that
class, this should all be familiar to you already, but it may still be
useful to refresh your understanding using these materials.

If you haven't taken the prerequisite courses and are getting up to
speed on your own, we hope these materials will be helpful. In class,
we will briefly review many of these concepts when they are relevant
(and, of course, I am happy to answer any questions and appreciate
being interrupted if I assume something that is unclear), but will
review them expecting students to already have fairly good
understanding of these ideas from previous courses.
