[Project 3](/project3) is now posted, and is due on Monday, 21 March
(as mentioned in class, we are not expecting you to work over spring
break, but are posting it now for people who want to get started
early).

Recall also from Wednesday, that you have the option to [start the
Final Project](/finalproject) early if you have an idea what you want
to do and submit an acceptable [Project
Idea](https://forms.gle/3tiqgYZRuNXrSzN56) by Tuesday, 15 March
(4:59pm) and have it approved. Students who do this will not need to do Project 3, but will have more time (and higher expectations with adjusted deadlines for some [Final Project deliverables](/finalproject), see the bottom of the post for details).
