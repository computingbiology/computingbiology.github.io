- There are hundreds of articles with different viewpoints on the more likely origins of Covid-19. These are two of the more balanced ones:

  - Carolyn Kormann. [_The Mysterious Case of the COVID-19 Lab-Leak Theory_](https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/the-mysterious-case-of-the-covid-19-lab-leak-theory). The New Yorker, 12 October 2021.

- Alina Chan and Matt Ridley's book [_Viral: The Search for the Origin of COVID-19_](https://www.amazon.com/Viral-Search-COVID-19-Matt-Ridley/dp/006313912X) pretends to be balanced (and I believe is mostly solid), but has a clear agenda.
