Welcome to the [cs4501: Computational Biology / Biological Computing](https://computingbiology.github.io/) Fall 2022 course site.

The Fall 2022 course is scheduled for Tuesdays and Thursdays,
12:30-1:45pm in Olsson Hall 120.

The course will be similar to the Spring 2022 course (which you can
explore [here](/s22), including the [Syllabus](/s22/syllabus/) and
[Schedule](/s22/schedule). Versions of these for the Fall 2022 course
will be posted here soon.
