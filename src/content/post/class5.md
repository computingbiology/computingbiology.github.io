## Readings

Before Thursday, 8 September:

- Read Chapter 5 of the _Bioinformatics
Algorithms_: [_How do we compare biological sequences?_](//www.bioinformaticsalgorithms.org/bioinformatics-chapter-5).

Before next Tuesday, 13 September:

- Read Chapter 19 -- 27 of Hubert's [The DNA
  Book](https://berthub.eu/dna-book/toc-real/). (Chapter 20 is a bit different, but may be useful to give you ideas for the kinds of things you could do for the Final Project.)

Before next Thursday, 15 September:

- Chapter 26 of  Manolis Kellis et al., _Computational Biology - Genomes, Networks, and Evolution_: [_Molecular Evolution and Phylogenetics_](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Computational_Biology/Book%3A_Computational_Biology_-_Genomes_Networks_and_Evolution_(Kellis_et_al.)/26%3A_Molecular_Evolution_and_Phylogenetics) (also available as [[PDF](/docs/kellis-ch26.pdf)]) (if you prefer to watch a video lecture that this chapter is based on, you can watch [_MIT CompBio Lecture 19 - Phylogenetics_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KduKR6IXcA)).
