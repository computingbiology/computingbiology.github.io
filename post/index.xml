      <description>Project 2 Project 2 is now posted, and is due on Wednesday, 21 September, 8:59pm.
Correction to Alignment Code! As was noticed in class today, the code for the gap-based alignment algorithms is wrong. The loops should include all values up to and including j (so should be
range(1, j + 1) instead of
range(1, j) (note that range in Python iterates through the values from the first input up to, but not including, the second input value, so to include j in the iteration, we need to use j + 1 in the range).</description>

      <description>Readings Before Thursday, 8 September:
 Read Chapter 5 of the Bioinformatics Algorithms: How do we compare biological sequences?.  Before next Tuesday, 13 September:
 Read Chapter 19 &amp;ndash; 27 of Hubert&amp;rsquo;s The DNA Book. (Chapter 20 is a bit different, but may be useful to give you ideas for the kinds of things you could do for the Final Project.)  Before next Thursday, 15 September:
 Chapter 26 of Manolis Kellis et al.</description>

      <description>Getting Email Notifications To get email notifications when there are posts in the Discussions site, you should select the &amp;ldquo;Watch&amp;rdquo; menu (upper right on https://github.com/computingbiology/fall2022) and select the notification you want. We recommend at least selecting from the &amp;ldquo;Custom&amp;rdquo; menu to get notifications for &amp;ldquo;Discussions&amp;rdquo; (if you want notifications for any updates, just select &amp;ldquo;All Activity&amp;rdquo;).
Schedule and Readings Project 1 is due on Monday, September 5 (8:59pm). See the project for submission instructions.</description>

      <description>Project 1 Project 1 is now posted, and is due on Monday, September 5 (8:59pm). Students will work in teams of two for Project 1, with constraints as discussed in Class 2: you can choose your partner or be assigned one “randomly” after class (today). If you choose your own partner, your team must satisfy these constraints:
 Both teammates went to different high schools Your answers to at least one of these questions must be different:  What country were you born in?</description>

      <description>Schedule and Readings Before 8:59pm Wednesday 24 August:
 Read the Syllabus, Pledge, and complete the Registration Survey. After you submit the Registration Survey, you will receive an invitation (to the github account you include in your survey) to join the course github site (which will enable you to join the github discussions).  Before Tuesday&amp;rsquo;s class, 30 August:
  Read Chapters 1 &amp;ndash; 10 of Hubert&amp;rsquo;s The DNA Book (the chapters are very short and interesting, so its not as much as it sounds).</description>

      <description>Here is a guide to the computing theory background expected for students entering this course.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve completed cs 2130 (Computer Systems and Organization 1) and a good Theory of Computation or Algorithms course (the official pre-requisites for this course) and remember the big ideas from that class, this should all be familiar to you already, but it may still be useful to refresh your understanding using these materials.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t taken the prerequisite courses and are getting up to speed on your own, we hope these materials will be helpful.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the cs4501: Computational Biology / Biological Computing Fall 2022 course site.
The Fall 2022 course is scheduled for Tuesdays and Thursdays, 12:30-1:45pm in Olsson Hall 120.
The course will be similar to the Spring 2022 course (which you can explore here, including the Syllabus and Schedule. Versions of these for the Fall 2022 course will be posted here soon.</description>
