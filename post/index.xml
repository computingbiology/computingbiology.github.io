      <description>Schedule and Readings Due Tuesday, 8 February (4:59pm): Project 1
Before Wednesday, 9 February:
 Read Chapter 19 &amp;ndash; 26 of Hubert&amp;rsquo;s The DNA Book. (Chapter 26 on Mutations and Changes is the one most relevant to today&amp;rsquo;s class.) Read Chapter 5 of the Bioinformatics Algorithms: How do we compare biological sequences?.  Before Monday, 14 Feb:
 Chapter 26 of Manolis Kellis et al., Computational Biology - Genomes, Networks, and Evolution: Molecular Evolution and Phylogenetics (also available as [PDF]) (if you prefer to watch a video lecture that this chapter is based on, you can watch MIT CompBio Lecture 19 - Phylogenetics).</description>

 Join the Course Slack Read the Syllabus, Pledge, and complete the Registration Survey.  Before Monday&amp;rsquo;s class, 24 January:
  Read Chapters 1 &amp;ndash; 10 of Hubert&amp;rsquo;s The DNA Book (the chapters are very short, so its not as much as it sounds). To access the early version of this book that we have access to, you will need the account information that will be sent to the course slack.</description>

      <description>You can join the course slack (with any @virginia.edu email address) by visiting: https://join.slack.com/t/computingbiology/signup.
We won&amp;rsquo;t expect students to be on the course slack until the first class (Wednesday, Jan 19 at 12:30pm), but feel free to join early!
(If you want to join but don&amp;rsquo;t have an @virginia.edu email address, contact the course instructor.)</description>

      <title>Computer Science Background</title>

      <description>Here is a guide to the computing theory background expected for students entering this course.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve completed cs2150 and a good Theory of Computation or Algorithms course (the official pre-requisites for this course) and remember the big ideas from that class, this should all be familiar to you already, but it may still be useful to refresh your understanding using these materials.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t taken the prerequisite courses and are getting up to speed on your own, we hope these materials will be helpful.</description>

      <description>This is the course website for &amp;ldquo;Computational Biology / Biological Computing&amp;rdquo;, a new University of Virginia course targeted to undergraduate computer science students that will be offered for the first time in Spring 2022. Scheduled course meetings are Mondays and Wednesday, 12:30pm – 1:45pm, in Olsson Hall 018, starting on 19 January 2022.
This course will look at connections between computing and biology, with a focus on DNA. It will include computational methods used in biology focusing on how computing can be used to analyze and design DNA, as well as opportunities to use biological substances and ideas to compute.</description>
