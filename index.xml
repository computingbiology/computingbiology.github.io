      <description>Your final project can be on anything you want that is related to this course. We want your final projects to be interesting and fun to work on, and to produce something of value beyond just satisfying an expectation of this course.
We are open to other types of projects, but are expecting most students will do one of these types of projects:
  Systematization Projects: Start with a curious question, learn what is currently understood about it from the research literature, and produce something to explain it to computer scientists.</description>

Correction to Alignment Code! As was noticed in class today, the code for the gap-based alignment algorithms is wrong. The loops should include all values up to and including j (so should be
range(1, j + 1) instead of
range(1, j) (note that range in Python iterates through the values from the first input up to, but not including, the second input value, so to include j in the iteration, we need to use j + 1 in the range).</description>

Students will work in teams of two for Project 1, with constraints as discussed in Class 2: you can choose your partner or be assigned one “randomly” after class (today). If you choose your own partner, your team must satisfy these constraints:
 Both teammates went to different high schools Your answers to at least one of these questions must be different:  What country were you born in?</description>

      <description>Here is a guide to the computing theory background expected for students entering this course.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve completed cs 2130 (Computer Systems and Organization 1) and a good Theory of Computation or Algorithms course (the official pre-requisites for this course) and remember the big ideas from that class, this should all be familiar to you already, but it may still be useful to refresh your understanding using these materials.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t taken the prerequisite courses and are getting up to speed on your own, we hope these materials will be helpful.</description>

      <description>When we consider the power of our computing models, we have been concerned with understanding what functions can be computed (in theory, which means without any arbitrary limits on their execution) by different computing models. When we want to actual compute using physical computers, cost matters.
For concerete computations where we already know the input and have an implementation of the algorithm, we can measure the cost of executing the algorithm by just running it and recording the cost.</description>

      <description>Honor Expectations As a student at the University of Virginia, you are trusted to be honorable and expected to behave in ways that merit that trust. We take advantage of this trust to provide a better learning environment for everyone. In particular, students in this course are expected to follow these rules throughout the course:
I will not lie, cheat or steal. If I am unsure whether something would be considered lying, cheating or stealing, I will ask before doing it.</description>

      <description>To reason precisely about what computers can and cannot do, we need abstract models that capture the things we think are important but avoid the complexities of physical objects.
Models and Mathematics The physical world is messy and suffers from arbitrary limits — this applies both to the physical computing devices we use (which always have some probability of failing and can&amp;rsquo;t even do arithmetic correcly) and even more so to biological systems we consider in this class.</description>

      <description>This syllabus is a &amp;ldquo;semi-living document&amp;rdquo; (i.e., more like a virus than a bacterium) subject to change as we adapt during the semester. The course website is managed through a public github repository, so you can see past versions and changes there.
The version as posted on the first day of class is available here, and history of changes.
Overview Course Description: This course will look at connections between computing and biology, with a focus on DNA.</description>
